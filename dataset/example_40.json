    "When I wrote the following pages, or rather the bulk of them, I lived alone, in the woods, a mile from any neighbor, in a house which I had built myself.",
    "I should not obtrude my affairs so much on the notice of my readers if very particular inquiries had not been made by my townsmen concerning my mode of life, which some would call impertinent.",
    "though they do not appear to me at all impertinent, but, considering the circumstances, very natural and pertinent. Some have asked what I got to eat; if I did not feel lonesome.",
    "I would fain say something, not so much concerning the Chinese and Sandwich Islanders as you who read these pages, who are said to live in New England; something about your condition.",
    "I have travelled a good deal in Concord; and everywhere, in shops, and offices, and fields, the inhabitants have appeared to me to be doing penance in a thousand remarkable ways.",
    "我听说过婆罗门坐在四堆火上看着太阳，或低着头悬挂在火焰上，或看着天空。",
    "我看到一些年轻人，我的乡亲们，他们的不幸在于继承了农场、房屋、谷仓、牲畜和农具；因为这些东西更容易获得，而不是摆脱。",
    "最好他们出生在空旷的牧场上，由狼哺育，这样他们就可以用更清楚的眼睛看到他们被召唤去劳动的领域。",
    "即使在这个相对自由的国家，大多数人也仅仅因为无知和错误，被生活中虚构的烦恼和多余的粗活所占据，以至于他们无法摘取生活中更美好的果实。",
    "我有时感到奇怪的是，我们竟会如此轻浮，我几乎可以说，竟会关注被称为黑人奴隶制的粗暴但却有些陌生的奴役形式，因为这里有如此多敏锐而精巧的主人。"
